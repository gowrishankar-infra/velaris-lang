"""Adversarial loops for the termination rule (SPEC.md section 9.5).

The rule claims `terminates` for exactly one shape: a counter that moves
one step toward a limit the body leaves alone. Every program here is
built to look like that shape while not being it - or to be it while
looking odd - and states the verdict each of its loops must get. A
wrong verdict is a bug in the analysis, never in this file.

Needs no theorem prover: the rule is syntactic, so this behaves
identically with and without z3.
