"""Secret of T: a value the type system will not let out (SPEC.md 3.1).

Every case here is a whole program, compiled or run by the real
compiler. The suite covers what an information-flow type has to get
right, and the places a hole would be:

  * every emitting builtin refuses a Secret argument, with E560 naming
    the value and where the secret came from
  * so does every fallible builtin, because a failure's reason is text
    the program can print and the runtime builds it out of the values
    it was given
  * a structure is not a way around it: a record field, a list element
    and a map value each make the whole thing carry the secret
  * a secret cannot be laundered through a helper, through a generic
    function with effects, through a 'fail' reason, or through a
    signature that says it returns a plain value
  * every pure operation over a secret keeps the secret, a comparison
    included: `key == c` is a Secret of Bool, nothing prints one, and
    nothing branches on one (E563) - because in a loop a plain Bool
    would read the whole key out a character at a time, which this
    suite demonstrates and then refuses
  * a promise may be about a secret, where a branch may not: a broken
    promise stops the run, cannot be caught and cannot accumulate
  * declassify is refused without the effect declared, refused by the
    budget without the grant, and refused without a reason written in
    the call; with all three it works, and the audit records it
  * velaris.audit/1's secrets section reports the sources, whether the
    program declassifies, and each reason
  * the tracer and a broken promise print <secret>, not the value
  * and an honest program that uses a secret correctly still runs

Needs no theorem prover: every rule here is a type rule.
