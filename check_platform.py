"""examples/platform must refuse what it says it refuses.

The example is a reference for platform teams, so the two guarantees it
claims are asserted here rather than described: a script whose declared
capability surface is wider than the platform permits never reaches
storage, and a script that reaches for an effect the pool does not grant
is refused while it runs - whatever the gate decided about it.

    python check_platform.py

fastapi is a dependency of the example, never of Velaris. Without it
(or without the http client its test client needs) this suite skips.
