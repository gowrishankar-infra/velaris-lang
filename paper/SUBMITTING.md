# Submitting velaris.md to arXiv: a checklist

A draft for the author. Nothing has been submitted. The rules below were
read from arXiv's own pages on 2026-09-11; each section names the page.
Where this file says "tested here", it means on the maintainer's
Windows machine, in a scratch directory, on that date.

## 1. Category: cs.PL, cross-listed to cs.CR

arXiv's descriptions (<https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy>):

- cs.PL: "Covers programming language semantics, language features,
  programming approaches ... Also includes material on compilers
  oriented towards programming languages ... Roughly includes material
  in ACM Subject Classes D.1 and D.3."
- cs.CR: "Covers all areas of cryptography and security including
  authentication, public key cryptosytems, proof-carrying code, etc.
  Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes D.4.6 and E.3."
- cs.SE: "Covers design tools, software metrics, testing and
  debugging, programming environments, etc. Roughly includes material
  in all of ACM Subject Classes D.2 ..."

**Recommendation: primary cs.PL, one cross-list to cs.CR.** What the
paper contributes is language design and its implementation: an effect
discipline in signatures checked across the call graph (2.1), the
semantics of a budget checked at each operation (2.2), contracts and
what the prover settles (2.3), and a format and check for a
repository's declared surface (2.4, 2.5), with a compiler and runtime
(3). That is cs.PL's "language features ... programming approaches ...
compilers". The motivation - running code nobody read, gradual attacks
- is security, and so is much of the related work (CaMeL, TACIT,
in-toto), which is why cs.CR readers should see it. But cs.CR would be
the wrong primary: the paper says plainly that the budget is not a
security boundary (sections 3 and 6), has no attack evaluation, and
does not claim to stop an adversary. cs.SE fits the ratchet (a CI
check) and could be a second cross-list; arXiv says "It is rarely
appropriate to add more than one or two cross-lists" and that "Bad
cross-lists will be removed" (<https://info.arxiv.org/help/cross.html>).
Moderators may reclassify either way
(<https://info.arxiv.org/help/moderation/index.html>).

## 2. What a first-time submitter needs

1. **An account** (<https://arxiv.org/user/register>). arXiv asks for a
   real, accurate identity ("It is a violation of our policies to
   misrepresent your identity"), one account per person, and names in
   the order "Firstname Lastname ... (where Lastname is your family
   name)" (<https://info.arxiv.org/help/prep.html>). With no
   institution, "Independent" is accepted as the organisation
   (<https://info.arxiv.org/help/registerhelp.html>). Linking an ORCID
   iD is recommended. The address used to submit is visible to
   registered arXiv users.
2. **An endorsement.** "arXiv requires that users be endorsed before
   submitting their first paper to arXiv or a new category"
   (<https://info.arxiv.org/help/endorsement.html>). Since 2026-01-21
   an institutional address no longer qualifies on its own: automatic
   endorsement needs both an institutional address and earlier
   authorship in the same endorsement domain; everyone else needs "a
   personal endorsement directly from an established arXiv author in the
   same endorsement domain", and arXiv staff cannot waive or provide one
   (<https://blog.arxiv.org/2026/01/21/attention-authors-updated-endorsement-policy/>).
   With a gmail address and no earlier arXiv paper, the personal route
   is the only one. How it works:
   - start a submission and choose cs.PL; arXiv emails an endorsement
     request with a link and a six-character code;
   - send that link to someone who has published in cs on arXiv
     recently and who knows you or will read the paper - the abstract
     page's "Which authors of this paper are endorsers?" link shows who
     can endorse; the endorser enters the code at
     <https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse>;
   - arXiv: "it is inappropriate to email large numbers of potential
     endorsers at once, or to repeatedly email the same endorser". Ask
     one or two people, with the paper attached.
3. **The right kind of paper.** Since October 2025 arXiv's cs category
   takes review articles and position papers only after peer review
   (<https://blog.arxiv.org/2025/10/31/attention-authors-updated-practice-for-review-articles-and-position-papers-in-arxiv-cs-category/>).
   This is a research article with an implementation and an
   evaluation, so that rule does not apply to it.
4. **A complete draft.** arXiv expects "complete final drafts"
   (<https://info.arxiv.org/help/policies/content-types.html>). Change
   the YAML `date:` line, which says "Draft of 2026-09-11 - not
   submitted", before building the upload (pandoc drops the HTML comment
   at the top; the date line reaches the PDF).
5. **A statement on AI use, in the paper.** arXiv requires authors "to
   report in their work any significant use of sophisticated tools ...
   in particular text-to-text generative AI", says each author takes
   "full responsibility for all its contents, irrespective of how the
   contents were generated", and that such tools "should not be listed
   as an author"
   (<https://info.arxiv.org/help/moderation/index.html#policy-for-authors-use-of-generative-ai-language-tools>).
   The paper's "Use of generative AI" section, between the conclusion
   and the reproducibility section, is that statement.
6. **Public links.** "Links to code or data sets must resolve to a
   publicly available repository"
   (<https://info.arxiv.org/help/policies/format_requirements.html>).
   Both repositories the paper names are public.

## 3. What to upload: the LaTeX source, not a PDF

**Superseded by the package.** `paper/arxiv/` holds the upload as built
on 2026-09-11 - `velaris.tex` with its bibliography as a BibTeX `.bbl`
(apalike), zipped as `paper/arxiv-submission.zip` - and
`paper/arxiv/README-for-me.txt` gives the form fields and how it was
built and checked with TeX Live 2025's pdflatex. The citeproc route
below still works, but the package is what to upload.

arXiv does "not accept ... PDF created from TeX/LaTeX source"
(<https://info.arxiv.org/help/submit/index.html>); a PDF from pandoc
goes through LaTeX, so upload the `.tex` and let arXiv compile it. arXiv
runs TeX Live 2025 by default, with pdflatex or xelatex; LuaLaTeX is not
supported (<https://info.arxiv.org/help/faq/texlive.html>).

Tools: pandoc (<https://pandoc.org/installing.html>; on Windows
`winget install --id JohnMacFarlane.Pandoc`), and, to check the build
before uploading, a LaTeX system - TeX Live 2025
(<https://tug.org/texlive/>), MiKTeX (`winget install --id
MiKTeX.MiKTeX`), or Tectonic (<https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/>).

From `paper/`, after editing the date:

    pandoc velaris.md --citeproc --standalone -V geometry:margin=1in -o velaris.tex
    pdflatex velaris.tex
    pdflatex velaris.tex

- `--citeproc` writes the references into the `.tex` (pandoc's
  default style, Chicago author-date), so no `.bib` or `.bbl` is
  uploaded. `--standalone` makes a complete document with the title
  block.
- `-V geometry:margin=1in` gives arXiv's minimum margin ("Minimum 1"
  page margin") and room for the widest code line (83 characters, in
  the reproducibility section). The default body size is 10 pt, inside
  arXiv's 10 to 14.
- Figure 1 is text in a code block, so there are no image files.
- Upload `velaris.tex` alone, then read the PDF arXiv builds from it
  before you confirm.

Tested here: pandoc 3.11 wrote `velaris.tex` from the paper as of this
commit, and Tectonic 0.17.0 (XeTeX engine) compiled it to 11 pages at
1-inch margins with no overfull lines. **Not tested: pdflatex**, which
is arXiv's default; no TeX Live or MiKTeX is installed on this machine.
The pandoc template supports both engines, and the only characters
outside ASCII that reach the `.tex` are two in reference names (ø in
Bjørner, č in Bračevac), which pdflatex's T1 encoding covers - but run
pdflatex before submitting.

## 4. Metadata

arXiv's metadata fields take ASCII only
(<https://info.arxiv.org/help/prep.html>).

| Field | Enter |
|---|---|
| Title | Velaris: effects in signatures, budgets at run time, and a baseline for a repository's capability surface |
| Authors | Gowri Shankar Palakurthi |
| Abstract | the text in section 6 below |
| Comments | 11 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables. Code: https://github.com/gowrishankar-infra/velaris-lang ; format and conformance corpus: https://github.com/gowrishankar-infra/velaris-spec |
| Primary category | cs.PL |
| Cross-list | cs.CR |
| ACM-class | D.3.3; D.4.6; D.2.4 |
| MSC-class, Report-no, Journal-ref, DOI | leave empty |

- **Authors.** arXiv wants given names first so that it indexes
  Palakurthi as the family name. The paper's own byline, "Palakurthi
  Gowri Shankar", can stay as it is or change to match; that is your
  choice, and arXiv does not require the PDF to match.
- **Comments.** arXiv asks for the number of pages and figures, and
  "submitted to" information if any; no copyright statements. Recount
  the pages from arXiv's build - 11 is the Tectonic build's count.
- **ACM-class.** arXiv's field takes codes of the 1998 ACM Computing
  Classification System, separated by "a semicolon and a space": D.3.3
  Language Constructs and Features, D.4.6 Security and Protection, D.2.4
  Software/Program Verification. All three were checked against ACM's
  1998 list as archived at web.archive.org (acm.org itself refuses
  automated fetches).

## 5. Licence

arXiv offers six (<https://info.arxiv.org/help/license/index.html>):
CC BY 4.0; CC BY-SA 4.0; CC BY-NC-SA 4.0; CC BY-NC-ND 4.0; the arXiv.org
perpetual, non-exclusive license 1.0; and CC Zero. "The license chosen
is irrevocable and cannot be changed", for that version; a later
version may carry a different one.

**Recommendation: CC BY 4.0.** The format the paper describes is CC0
and the implementation MIT-licensed; CC BY keeps the paper as open as
both while keeping attribution, which CC0 would give up, and arXiv
"encourages choosing a liberal license". The exception: if you mean to
submit the paper to a journal or conference that requires an exclusive
copyright transfer, read its preprint policy first; the arXiv
non-exclusive licence is the choice that commits you to least.

## 6. The abstract, ready to paste

1,729 characters, all ASCII; arXiv's limit is 1,920 ("abstracts longer
than 1920 characters will not be accepted"). Nothing was trimmed. It is
the paper's abstract as it stands, on one line; paste it as one
paragraph.

```text
Code written by language models is increasingly run by people who have not read it. Velaris is a small programming language for that situation. A function's signature declares which of seven effects it may perform, and the compiler checks the declaration across the whole call graph. A runtime refuses any operation outside a budget the operator writes - before the operation happens, and in a way the program cannot catch. Contracts are checked by the Z3 prover where it can settle them, and at run time where it cannot. A repository can commit a baseline of the capability surface its programs need, and a check fails any change that needs more. The central claim is about that surface. Suppose a repository's Velaris programs are held to a committed baseline by a required check. If a change makes a program need an effect, path, host, module or operation count the baseline does not grant, the check fails. It goes on failing at every later commit at which the program still compiles and still needs it, until a person edits the baseline. The claim is not about which function an effect is attributed to: a function renamed in the change that gives it an effect its program already had escapes the function-level rule. On a benchmark of 63 programs, 56 with one defect and 7 correct, each written in Velaris, in JavaScript for Deno and in Python, Velaris caught 54 of the 56 defects, 42 of them before running; Deno caught 32 and Python 28; none of the three flagged a correct program. One of Velaris's two misses is a logic error with no contract; the other no tool should catch. The capability format is published separately, under CC0, with a conformance corpus of 444 cases that an implementation in any language can run.
```

If the paper's abstract changes, count it again: this count is of the
text as pasted, with the Markdown backticks removed and the lines joined
by single spaces.

## 7. The order to do it in

1. Done: the AI-use statement is in the paper, and `paper/arxiv/` holds
   the package, checked with pdflatex; its build leaves out the draft
   date line (section 3).
2. Find one endorser who knows the work; register; start the
   submission in cs.PL and send them the endorsement link.
3. Once endorsed: upload `velaris.tex` and `velaris.bbl` from
   `paper/arxiv/` (zipped locally as `paper/arxiv-submission.zip`, which
   is not committed), enter the metadata (section 4), choose the
   licence (section 5), read arXiv's build, submit.
