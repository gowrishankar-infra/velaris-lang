## Software Heritage

Both repositories were submitted to the Software Heritage archive
through its save-code-now API
(`POST https://archive.softwareheritage.org/api/1/origin/save/git/url/<origin>/`),
twice. The request ids, request dates, visit dates and snapshot
identifiers are the ones the API returned.

The first pair was requested just before velaris-lang 4.1.0 and
velaris-spec 0.4 were pushed, and the archive visited before the push,
so these snapshots hold the history up to velaris-lang 4.0.1 and
velaris-spec 0.3:

| Origin | Save request | Requested (UTC) | Visited (UTC) | Snapshot | `main` in the snapshot |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| https://github.com/gowrishankar-infra/velaris-lang | 2471043 | 2026-09-11T10:39:14.948887Z | 2026-09-11T10:39:19.973Z | `swh:1:snp:e4b061fba4098c65f910059d6e3a7c36c7b06e82` | `c080c9f140d06f56a067ff373a09ab89ca76d4c7` (4.0.1) |
| https://github.com/gowrishankar-infra/velaris-spec | 2471044 | 2026-09-11T10:39:16.118803Z | 2026-09-11T10:39:20.075Z | `swh:1:snp:cd54a6a90ef956dcc767b5e3340ff6ad8e18a2a6` | `e2622eb3ba87edd233cdc6fdbfe9113d16bd70d8` (0.3) |

The second pair was requested after the 4.1.0 and 0.4 push; these are
the snapshots taken after it, holding tags `v4.1.0` and `v0.4`:

| Origin | Save request | Requested (UTC) | Visited (UTC) | Snapshot | `main` in the snapshot |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| https://github.com/gowrishankar-infra/velaris-lang | 2471049 | 2026-09-11T10:41:21.003154Z | 2026-09-11T10:41:22.251Z | `swh:1:snp:9d8d969d83aac1f1970d5d08ba3755085f28f82c` | `3c81ed1353d3dc1aeec2779329ce59e324f39114` (4.1.0) |
| https://github.com/gowrishankar-infra/velaris-spec | 2471050 | 2026-09-11T10:41:22.084845Z | 2026-09-11T10:41:32.013Z | `swh:1:snp:578ec668186a85ea1eeb8c0a14d77736d3e40186` | `2bf8bbe189a81582772b5c6549cef6fda18524e2` (0.4) |
