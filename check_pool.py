"""A pool must be faster than a fresh process AND leak nothing between
programs.

The speed is why velaris.Pool exists. The isolation is why it can be
used at all: a worker that serves one program after another in one
process is exactly the place where one program's leftovers become the
next program's starting state. Every rule in Pool's docstring is
asserted here, and the last check is the speed, so the trade is visible
in one run.

    python check_pool.py

Nothing here depends on the prover. Run it in a Python with no
z3-solver as well; ARCHITECTURE.md rule 6 says why.
