Velaris — "The language where you can trust code you didn't write."

New in v2.36: examples/linkcheck.vel - a tool worth running, not a
    demonstration - and network failures that say what happened
    instead of quoting the implementation.

New in v2.2: out-of-the-box readiness.
    velaris doctor          check your setup, with exact fixes
    velaris new myproject   start a project with running code
    Standalone executables (no Python needed) are built for every
    release - download one file and go.

New in v2.1: a documentation site in docs/ (python build_docs.py).
    The library page is parsed from std.vel by this very compiler -
    contracts included - and the error index is scraped from this
    file, so the docs cannot go stale.

v2.0 - THE BUILTINS KEEP THE LANGUAGE'S PROMISE (breaking change):
    to_int, get-on-a-map, read_file, and fetch can now FAIL instead of
    killing the program - and therefore must be called through check
    or try, like any fallible function. The compiler walks you to
    every call that needs updating (error E520). get on a LIST is
    unchanged: list bounds are the prover's job. New: get_or(m, k,
    default) - a total map lookup that never fails.

New in v1.20: sort_by in the standard library (generic sorting by an
    Int key function), and the ledger app gains a 'report' command
    built on it - sorted listing, biggest, smallest, totals.

New in v1.19: a grown-up standard library. stdlib/std.vel now holds
    sixteen functions written in Velaris - including sort, which
    ensures is_sorted(result) using is_sorted, also from the library.
    Violating a library requires is a compile error at your call site.

New in v1.18: FLOAT PROOFS - real IEEE-754, not pretend-math.
    Promises about Float values are proven in Z3's floating-point
    theory, bit-for-bit the arithmetic your machine performs. The
    prover will happily refute x + 0.1 + 0.1 == x + 0.2, because in
    floating point it is false - and Velaris does not pretend.

New in v1.17: FAILURE-AWARE PROOFS. The prover now understands fail,
    check, and try - so promises on 'or fail' functions are proven for
    every path that actually returns. Failing early on bad input makes
    the remaining promise EASIER to prove, and the prover knows it.

New in v1.16: QUANTIFIED LIST PROOFS.
    all_of(xs, p) / any_of(xs, p) ask whether a predicate holds for
    every / some element - and promises using them are PROVEN where Z3
    can settle the quantifier, with runtime checks guarding the rest.
    ensures all_of(result, is_positive)   is now a provable sentence.

New in v1.15: NATIVE Float and Bool. The LLVM backend now compiles pure
    functions over Int, Float, and Bool (division and % stay interpreted
    in both types, so dividing by zero is always a clean error, never a
    silent infinity). Interpreted and native runs are verified to agree.

New in v1.14: RECORD PROOFS. Promises about record fields are now
    proven before running - ensures result.x == p.x + dx is mathematics,
    and a swapped-fields bug is a compile-time counterexample with the
    record values shown. Works for records whose fields are Int, Bool,
    or other such records; lists/Float fields stay runtime-checked.

New in v1.13: the first real app - examples/ledger.vel, an expense
    tracker written in Velaris (records, contracts, or-fail parsing,
    file persistence). Two supporting builtins: chars(text) splits Text
    into single characters (pure), and file_exists(path) checks before
    reading (fs).

New in v1.12: continuous integration + repo hygiene.
    Every push is tested by GitHub Actions on Linux and Windows,
    Python 3.10 and 3.12, WITH and WITHOUT the optional dependencies -
    plus formatter and playground checks. CHANGELOG.md tells the story.

New in v1.11: a LANGUAGE SERVER - errors as you type, in any LSP editor.
    velaris lsp
    Fast checks (effects + types) on every keystroke; the full pipeline
    including Z3 proofs on save. The VS Code extension in editor/vscode
    now launches it automatically (no extra dependencies).

New in v1.10: a formatter - one canonical style for every .vel file.
    velaris fmt program.vel            rewrite in place (if needed)
    velaris fmt program.vel --stdout   print instead of writing
    velaris fmt program.vel --check    exit 1 if not formatted (for CI)

New in v1.9: a REPL - try Velaris line by line.
    velaris repl
    Loose lines run immediately (checked while running); fn / record /
    import definitions get the FULL treatment - effects, types, and
    Z3 proofs - before they are accepted into the session.

New in v1.8: a real install.
    pip install .          (from a clone; add [full] for proofs + native)
    velaris program.vel    (the command, anywhere; it gets io - 5.0)
    import "std.vel" now finds the shipped standard library from any
    folder - imports check relative-to-your-file first, then stdlib.

New in v1.7: GENERICS - one function, every type.
    fn first(xs: List of T) -> T for any T
        requires length(xs) > 0
    { return get(xs, 0) }
    T is inferred at each call; conflicting uses are clear errors.
    Plus: examples/std.vel - the first standard library, written in
    Velaris itself.

New in v1.6: FUNCTIONS ARE VALUES - pass them to other functions.
    fn apply(xs: List of Int, f: fn(Int) -> Int) -> List of Int { ... }
    apply(nums, double)
    Only PURE functions (no effects, no fail) can be passed - so a
    passed-in function can never smuggle hidden behavior.

New in v1.5: failure is visible and UNIGNORABLE.
    fn parse(t: Text) -> Int or fail { ... fail "reason" ... }
    Callers must handle it:  check parse(t) { ok v {...} fail why {...} }
    or pass it upward inside another fallible function:  try parse(t)
    Calling a fallible function any other way is a compile error.

New in v1.4: MAPS - lookup tables, written {"alice": 30, "bob": 25}.
    Typed as: Map of Text to Int (keys are Text or Int).
    get(m, key) reads, has(m, key) checks, put(m, key, v) returns a new
    map, keys(m) lists the keys, length(m) counts entries.

New in v1.3: Float - decimal numbers like 3.14.
    Int and Float never mix silently: 1 + 2.5 is a compile error with a
    fix (use to_float(1), or round(2.5) for an Int). Float math is
    runtime-checked; proofs stay Int-only for now.

New in v1.2: a browser playground - open playground/index.html and run
    Velaris with zero install (rebuild it with: python build_playground.py).

New in v1.1: escape sequences in text - \n newline, \t tab, \" quote,
    \\ backslash - plus a VS Code syntax highlighter in editor/vscode.
New in v1.0: the testers' release.
    * Multiple problems are reported in one run (one per function),
      instead of stopping at the first.
    * to_text(x) turns any value into Text.
    * --version prints the version.

New in v0.16: IMPORTS - programs can span multiple files.
    import "mathlib.vel"
    Paths are relative to the importing file; imports chain and cycles
    are safe; a name defined in two files is a clear error; and error
    messages name the file the problem actually lives in.

New in v0.15: RECORDS - group named fields into one value.
    record Point { x: Int  y: Int }
    let p = Point(x: 3, y: 4)      then      p.x
    Records are immutable: build a new one instead of changing fields.

New in v0.14: the usability pack.
    else if chains, the % remainder operator, and text tools:
    split, contains, upper, lower.

New in v0.13: LIST PROOFS via Z3's theory of arrays.
    Contracts and code over lists (length, get, push) are now provable,
    and every 'get' carries a bounds obligation - reading past the end
    of a list can be proven and rejected before the program runs (E705).

New in v0.12: interactive programs.
    ask("your name?")   reads a line from the keyboard (an io effect)
    to_int(text)        turns text into an Int (pure; clean error if not
                        a whole number)

New in v0.11: fetch(url) is REAL - an actual HTTP GET with a 10-second
    timeout, guarded by 'uses net'. A function without 'uses net' in its
    signature provably cannot touch the network. Failures are clean
    Velaris errors (E606), never tracebacks.

New in v0.10: LOOP INVARIANTS - the prover learned loops.
    while i <= n
        invariant total >= 0
    { ... }
    Velaris proves the invariant holds at loop entry, survives every step,
    and uses it to prove the function's promises. Unproven invariants are
    still checked at runtime on every iteration.

New in v0.9: NATIVE SPEED via LLVM. Pure Int math functions (no effects,
    no contracts, no lists/text) are compiled to real machine code and
    run at C-like speed; everything else stays safely interpreted.
    Flags:  --time       show how long the run took
            --no-native  force the interpreter for everything
    (needs: pip install llvmlite ; without it, everything still runs)

New in v0.8: MODULAR proofs - verification composes across functions.
    When A calls B, the prover uses B's promises to prove A's promises,
    and proves A can never violate B's 'requires' at the call site (E701).
New in v0.7: compile-time PROOFS via the Z3 theorem prover.
    For simple functions, broken promises are now proven false and the
    program is rejected BEFORE it runs - with an exact counterexample.
    Functions Z3 cannot handle (loops, lists, text math) safely fall
    back to runtime promise checks, exactly as in v0.5.
    (needs: pip install z3-solver ; without it, runtime checks still guard)
New in v0.6: negative numbers, and / or / not, and lists.
    let scores = [42, -7, 99]
    fn biggest(xs: List of Int) -> Int requires length(xs) > 0 { ... }
New in v0.5: contracts. Functions make promises; Velaris enforces them.
    fn discount(price: Int) -> Int
        requires price >= 0        <- promise about inputs (caller's duty)
        ensures result >= 0        <- promise about output (function's duty)
Contracts must be pure: a promise cannot print, fetch, or write files.
New in v0.4: while loops and changeable variables.
    while i <= n { total = total + i   i = i + 1 }
New in v0.3: full type checking before the program runs.
    add("hello", 5)   -> rejected at compile time, not a runtime crash
New in v0.2: effects split into io, net, fs, clock, rand.

Pipeline:  source text -> LEXER -> tokens -> PARSER -> AST
           -> EFFECT CHECKER (the special part) -> INTERPRETER

Design rules:
  * Plain English keywords: fn, let, return, if, else, uses
  * A function with no `uses` clause is PURE. Pure functions cannot
    print, touch files, or the network — the compiler proves it.
  * Errors are friendly for humans AND structured (JSON) for AI agents.

Usage:
  python3 velaris.py program.vel          # run a program (it gets io)
  python3 velaris.py program.vel --json   # errors come out as JSON too

    refused_effect; it cannot be caught by the program.

    allow=None is the same io: the console and nothing else. That is a
    change in 5.0, where it used to grant all seven effects. To ask for
    every effect, say so - allow="all", which writes one line to stderr,

    timeout (seconds) and max_memory_mb bound the OTHER two things a

    memory. With either set, the program runs in a separate process
    that is killed on breach, and the result says which limit it hit.
    An agent framework calling this ten thousand times needs both.

    Memory limits use RLIMIT_AS on POSIX and a job object with
    JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_PROCESS_MEMORY on Windows: enforced on Linux and,
    since 3.1, on Windows; best-effort on macOS, where the limit is set
    but not reliably honoured and the timeout is what stops a runaway.
    If the Windows job object cannot be made the cap is recorded and not
    enforced rather than the run failing. memory_cap_is_enforced() says
    which of those this machine is. The timeout is enforced everywhere.

    Calling this in a loop starts an interpreter every time. velaris.Pool

# Memory caps, per platform
#
#     POSIX: the child sets RLIMIT_AS on itself before it does anything
#     else, from --max-memory-mb on its own command line. It used to be
#     a preexec_fn in the parent, which is documented as unsafe when the
#     parent has threads - and the HTTP door, and now Pool, both do.
#
#     Windows: there is no RLIMIT_AS. The equivalent is a job object
#     with JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_PROCESS_MEMORY, which the parent must build
#     before the child runs. So the child is created suspended, assigned
#     to the job, and only then resumed: no instruction of the child
#     runs outside the cap.
#
#     If any of it fails, the cap is recorded and not enforced - the
#     behaviour Velaris had on Windows before 3.1 - rather than the run
#     failing. The timeout is enforced on every platform either way.

#
#     A run with a timeout or a memory cap starts a Python interpreter,
#     which costs about a tenth of a second before a line of Velaris is
#     read. An agent platform calling run() thousands of times an hour
#     pays that every time. A Pool keeps workers alive and hands each
#     program to an idle one.
#
#     Speed is why it exists; isolation is why it can be used. Every
#     rule in Pool's docstring is asserted in check_pool.py, because a
#     fast sandbox that leaks state between programs is worse than a
#     slow one.

        pool.close()                       # also a context manager

    A bounded run costs an interpreter's startup - about a tenth of a
    second - before a line of Velaris is read. A pool pays that once
    per worker instead of once per program.

    The isolation rules, which matter more than the speed:

    * THE BUDGET IS THE POOL'S, NOT THE PROGRAM'S. It is parsed once,
      here, and installed by each worker at startup; `run` on a pool
      takes no allow argument. allow=None is `io` from 5.0, as it is
      everywhere else, where it used to be all seven effects. A caller who needs a different budget
      makes a different pool. Nothing a program does can widen it: the
      budget is re-asserted from this object before every program,
      which also puts the per-run operation counts (@N) back to zero,
      so one program cannot spend another's allowance.

    * A WORKER IS USED ONCE UNLESS THE RUN WAS CLEAN. Anything other
      than ok - a refused effect, a failure that escaped, a program
      that did not compile, the timeout, the memory cap - retires the
      worker: it is killed and a fresh one takes its place. Only a run
      that finished cleanly hands its worker back. That costs a
      restart on every rejected program, and it is the rule that makes
      the rest of this list checkable.

    * A REUSED WORKER STARTS EMPTY. Before every program the child
      resets every piece of module-level mutable state there is: the
      arguments, the Python handles, the native compiler's engines and
      the text arena they own, the tracer, the budget and its counts -
      and the working directory, the environment and the recursion
      limit, which a program granted ffi can change.
      `reset_program_state` lists all of it.

    * THE PARENT OWNS THE DEADLINE. A worker that has not answered
      within `timeout` is killed by this process; the call returns
      E610 and a replacement is started. The memory cap is set in the
      child at startup, the same way a bounded `run` sets it.

    * CLOSING KILLS EVERY WORKER, including one still running a
      program. A pool collected without close() is closed by its
      finalizer; a pool that outlives the interpreter is closed at
      exit; and a worker whose pipe closes ends by itself, so a parent
      that dies without doing either still leaves nothing behind.

    `run` is safe to call from several threads: each call takes an idle
    worker and blocks while none is free.

    What a pool does NOT change: the effect budget is the same guard it
    is everywhere else in Velaris, and the same things sit outside it -
    a granted ffi module can do whatever that module can do, in a
    worker as anywhere. THREAT_MODEL.md is the long form.

# 17. THE CAPABILITY RATCHET
#
#     A repository declares the capability surface it may have in
#     velaris.capabilities, and `velaris capabilities check` fails a
#     working tree that needs more. The comparison is always with that
#     file, never with the previous commit: capability is binary and
#     cumulative, so a surface assembled over forty small commits is
#     reported in full at every one of them - against what was declared -
#     rather than as forty small steps each measured from the last.
#     `velaris review --against REF` reports the delta from a git ref to
#     the working tree, for a pull request; it informs, the check gates.
#
#     What a program needs is read from its text: its functions' `uses`
#     clauses, the literal paths, hosts and modules its calls name, and a
#     bound on the fs and net operations one run can perform. The effect
#     and type checks run and the prover does not, so the answer is the
#     same with and without z3. velaris-spec SPEC.md section 9 states
#     every rule used here.

#
#     velaris-spec's tests/ directory is a conformance corpus for the
#     capability format: JSON cases an implementation in any language runs
#     its own way (velaris-spec CONFORMANCE.md, tests/README.md). This
#     repository's build_conformance.py writes it from check_sandbox.py,
#     check_library.py and check_ratchet.py. `velaris conformance` reads it
#     back and holds this implementation to it through the doors another
#     implementation would use: the budget parser, the audit, a run under a
#     budget from the command line, and the baseline writer and check. It
#     computes nothing from the case but what the case says, and a case it
#     does not understand fails.

#
#     `velaris attest` wraps velaris.audit/1 in an in-toto Statement v1 of
#     the predicate type velaris-spec 8.5 defines: the audited file and
#     every file it loads are the subjects, by sha256, and the predicate's
#     audit is audit()'s own output - not a copy recomputed here - so the
#     attestation and the audit cannot disagree, and the attestation says
#     nothing the audit does not. What the audit could not determine it
#     says so in its own fields (ffi_any, read_any, any, a null count, ok
#     false), and the Statement carries them as they are. Nothing here
#     signs: EMBEDDING.md shows how, with cosign or sigstore-python, and
#     the release workflow does it for one example program.
