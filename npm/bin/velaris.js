// Velaris's compiler is one Python file. This hands your arguments to
// it, and if it is not installed, says exactly how to fix that rather
// than failing with a confusing spawn error.
//
// It also says when the compiler it found is older than this package.
// Two things can go wrong quietly otherwise: a stale Velaris earlier in
// PATH shadows a newer one, and a subcommand added after that stale
// version came out is read by the old compiler as a file name, so
// `npx velaris-lang mcp` fails with "cannot find file 'mcp'".

// to the compiler's own dispatch, so a new subcommand cannot be added
// without an entry here.
