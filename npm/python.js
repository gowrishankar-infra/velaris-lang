// Finding the Python that holds the Velaris compiler.
//
// The npm package is a wrapper, not a copy: it finds a Python that can
// import `velaris` and calls it. Until 4.3.4 it took the first Python
// that could import the module at all, which meant an old Velaris in an
// early candidate silently shadowed a newer one further down - and a
// subcommand added after that old version came out looked to the user
// like a missing file rather than a missing compiler.
//
// So: ask every candidate which version it has, and take the newest.
// The caller decides what to say when the newest is still older than
// the package that invoked it; what this module promises is that the
// choice is made on version and that the version is known.

// so every real Velaris answers; something importable as `velaris` that
// is not one is reported as a null version rather than as no Velaris at
// all, and ranks below everything that can say what it is.
