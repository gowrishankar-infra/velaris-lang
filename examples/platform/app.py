"""A platform that lets its customers write Velaris.

A SaaS team wants its customers to write their own rules - a discount, a
routing decision, a validation - and has to decide, before one of them
runs on the team's machines, what it may touch. For a rule that computes
money it also has to know the arithmetic holds, which no sandbox can
answer.

    POST /scripts           a customer submits source. It is audited and
                            stored with its capability surface, and what
                            it declares comes back. Nothing runs.
    GET  /scripts/{id}      what that script declares - the page a
                            customer is shown before enabling it.
    POST /scripts/{id}/run  runs it on a pool whose budget is the
                            platform's, never the script's.

Two guards, and they are not the same guard. The audit reads the text:
it says what a script declares, and submission is refused when that is
wider than the platform permits, naming the grants that would have to be
added. The pool enforces: its budget is installed by the worker before
the program is read, a program cannot widen it, and a refusal cannot be
caught. Where the audit cannot read a path, host or module - a value
built while running - it widens to the plain effect and the gate refuses
that; the pool never depends on the audit having been right.

Storage is a dict in this process. README.md says what a real one adds.
